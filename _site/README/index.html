<h1>JAMstack personal blog demo</h1>
<p>Blog site made using Eleventy, Nunjucks, Netlify, Cloudinary, Formspree and Algoliasearch.</p>
<p>I used a ready-made Bootstrap theme which I then edited and connected with all the tools/services that were needed to make it run.
It's deployed on Netlify. It's using Cloudinary for image/video storage. Contact form and search are functioning through Formspree and Algolia respectively.
There's also an admin panel (by Netlify) through which the user can add/edit/delete blog posts (for which I have to send email invitation, of course :) )</p>
